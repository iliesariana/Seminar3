Once upon a time, in a far far away kingdom, there was a really nice damsel (not in distress btw) that could not figure out for the life of it how github works.
The princess went to her father, the king, and requested 4 meetings with the wisest scholars in the area, but they all arrived at the same time for the audience, so now the princess must make a really clever choice.
The first scholar, even if he is the young and doesn't have a lot of experience, still came to see her.
The second scholar, a well-known witch that bases her work on the stars and planets, came to teach her.
The third scholar is a small goblin with big promises.
The forth scholar is ghost with a lot of spell experience so far.

Who should the princess meet first? Be careful, your choice will affect the storyline. What choice should the princess make?
(1) First scholar (2) Second scholar (3) Third scholar (4) Forth scholar

(1)
    The first scholar entered shily into the damsel's chamber. 
    The very first thing he noticed was her amazing beauty, golden locks and blue eyes.
    His face turned red as a tomato within seconds.
    "H-Hello, miss... N-nice to see you! I MEAN - meet you" escaped his lips.
    The young lady noticed his shyness right away.

    How should the damsel react like?
    Go to (5) if you want her to think he was cute, or (9) if she's offended by his unprofessionalism.

(5)
    The princess responds, matching his shyness: "Hello to you too!"
    The young man snaps back into his usual, serious persona. He's taken aback by his own actions.
    "How could I have been so indecent?" he said to himself.
    "I'm very sorry for my clumsy introduction. My name is Alec and I'm very happy to assist you in whatever you'll need me."
    "Thank you Alec, that's very nice of you! I'm hearing you're quite new to this as well?"

    What should Alec do now? Lie about his experience or stay true to himself?
    Lie (13) or say the truth (17)
    
(9)
    <<Ew why is he... like that?>> she thought to herself.
    "Oh.. she looks.. disgusted" he said under his breath.
    "I'm sorry?" 
    "Nothing of importance! Hello miss, my name is Alec and I'll assist you in learning github"
    "I'm sorry to say but you don't look too.. confident"
    "I can assure you I am well equipt to answer all of your questions."
    "Is that so?"

    Go to (21) if you want her to be nice to him or (25) if she'd want another scholar because she feels uncomfortable with his expertise.
