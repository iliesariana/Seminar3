Once upon a time, in a far far away kingdom, there was a really nice damsel (not in distress btw) that could not figure out for the life of it how github works.
The princess went to her father, the king, and requested 4 meetings with the wisest scholars in the area, but they all arrived at the same time for the audience, so now the princess must make a really clever choice.
The first scholar, even if he is the young and doesn't have a lot of experience, still came to see her.
The second scholar, a well-known witch that bases her work on the stars and planets, came to teach her.
The third scholar is a small goblin with big promises.
The forth scholar is ghost with a lot of spell experience so far.

Who should the princess meet first? Be careful, your choice will affect the storyline. What choice should the princess make?
(1) First scholar (2) Second scholar (3) Third scholar (4) Forth scholar

(2) YEEES!!! You chose the witch as the first audience. Let's go on with our story...
The princess enters the audience room and she notices an awful smell coming from the right corner of the room. The witch is already there, 
waiting for her, with a spaced-out look on her face.
You begin to introduce yourself and the problem you have faced with github and branching so far but the witch stars humming a song about 
the motions of planet Aranxia. 
What would you like the princess to do?
(6) Interrupt the witch and get back on track (10) Let her finish the song

(6) Ooooooooh, you chose to interrupt the witch, thing that makes her really angry and now she starts throwing spells at the the princess.
The princess is more confused now and she starts to get anxious. 
"Please, let me tell you why I need your help!", says the princess.
"You have disturbed my ancient planet-star crossing ritual!!! You have doomed you people to 1000 years of drought, you stupid child!!!!", says angrily the crazy witch.
The princess runs from the room, crying, learning how to manage github dissappearing from her top-priorities. :)))
