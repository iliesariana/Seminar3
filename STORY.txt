Once upon a time, in a far far away kingdom, there was a really nice damsel (not in distress btw) that could not figure out for the life of it how github works.
The princess went to her father, the king, and requested 4 meetings with the wisest scholars in the area, but they all arrived at the same time for the audience, so now the princess must make a really clever choice.
The first scholar, even if he is the young and doesn't have a lot of experience, still came to see her.
The second scholar, a well-known witch that bases her work on the stars and planets, came to teach her.
The third scholar is a small goblin with big promises.
The forth scholar is ghost with a lot of spell experience so far.

Who should the princess meet first? Be careful, your choice will affect the storyline. What choice should the princess make?
(1) First scholar (2) Second scholar (3) Third scholar (4) Forth scholar

(2) YEEES!!! You chose the witch as the first audience. Let's go on with our story...
The princess enters the audience room and she notices an awful smell coming from the right corner of the room. The witch is already there, 
waiting for her, with a spaced-out look on her face.
You begin to introduce yourself and the problem you have faced with github and branching so far but the witch stars humming a song about 
the motions of planet Aranxia. 
What would you like the princess to do?
(6) Interrupt the witch and get back on track (10) Let her finish the song

(4) The ghost is the first scholar that the princess meets. The ghost is a very experienced spell caster and he is very eager to help the princess.
The ghost is very experienced and ready to help the princess but his help comes with a prcie.
The ghost needs a spell to come alive again and he needs the princess to help with it.
The spell is really risky beause if it goes worng all of it's kingdom will be cursed, but the ghost is the only one that can help the princess
learn how to use github.
What should the princess do?
(8) Help the ghost with the spell (12) Refuse to help the ghost
