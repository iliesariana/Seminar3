Once upon a time, in a far far away kingdom, there was a really nice damsel (not in distress btw) that could not figure out for the life of it how github works.
The princess went to her father, the king, and requested 4 meetings with the wisest scholars in the area, but they all arrived at the same time for the audience, so now the princess must make a really clever choice.
The first scholar, even if he is the young and doesn't have a lot of experience, still came to see her.
The second scholar, a well-known witch that bases her work on the stars and planets, came to teach her.
The third scholar is a small goblin with big promises.
The forth scholar is ghost with a lot of spell experience so far.

Who should the princess meet first? Be careful, your choice will affect the storyline. What choice should the princess make?
(1) First scholar (2) Second scholar (3) Third scholar (4) Forth scholar


(3)
    Between the four scholars, the goblin might look like the best candidate for helping the princess, but that is the exact opposite.
    The creature wants to lead the damsel to mistakes while working on github, with the purpose of capturing her crown and also her GitHub Repositories!!!
    The damsel made the wrong choice
